# Heart_disease_prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the risk of heart disease using patient health data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate to support early diagnosis and prevention.
# overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques based on patient health data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate.
# objective
